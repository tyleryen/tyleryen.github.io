												<h3>Financial Planning and Analysis Intern</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Summer 2016 was spent in the city that never sleeps.  I worked for Unified, a unique company that delivers advertising, professional, and campaign automation services.  Unified partners with big brand names such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Snapchat.</p>  

											<p>My official title was an FP&A intern.  I worked on a few projects with their investment bank <a href="http://cyndxadvisors.com/">here</a> to build business valuation and waterfall decks.  I would usually spend my mornings at Cyndx, then walk to Unified in the afternoons.  See more about my Cyndx experience <a href="cyndx.html">here</a>.</p> 

											<p>At Unified I helped build a new financial model for the company.  This involved taking a 17 MB Excel file, and condensing it down to something that is much closer to 5.  I had exposure working with tons of tabs that all had to tie together, some of which included tracking all historical and current employees, projecting future revenue streams, building out expenses, using pivot tables to tie data together, and macros to simplify certain processes. </p>

											<p>As well, I was able to complete other tasks such as drafting an updated chart of accounts while the company was in the midst of transitioning business management softwares.  I was able to work on building out bonus payouts to employees, easy to read tax profiles based on locations of clients, and put together decks to show investors. </p> 

											<p>Unified was a great experience and I was able to work closely with the whole finance team, I met with the CFO almost on a daily basis, and lived with the COO/President of the company.  I would like to thank everyone at Unified for an amazing summer! </p>
