												<h3>Mobile Dev Team!</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The internship program was very well organized and executed.  There were about 25 interns, and 5 who worked with me on the mobile team (pictured above).  Some of the projects were collaborative, and some individual.  It was great to learn from others and see some of the other interesting projects going on.  </p>

												<h3>Software Developent Intern</h3>
											</header>
											<p>At VoiceBox Technologies, I had the opportunity to work with the mobile development team on a portal website project.  I created a javascript voice application which will record a user's voice via computer microphone or headset microphone, and then recognize when the user is done speaking (silence detection), before sending it to the server.  As well, I implemented a drag and drop feature for an already saved command, as well as a download option for a current command.  This application was created with both node javascript, and angular javascript.  A modified version of the application is currently being used by VoiceBox.</p>
											<p>As well, I did wrote some unit and end to end tests to test functions throughout the website.  I created some error handling functions which redirects a user to 404(page not found) and 401(user not authorized) error pages, as well as sending that data to the server.  I had the opportunity to work with a variety of node.js packages, some of which include chai, express, jade, mocha, mongoDB, mongoose, passport, recorder, and request.  I utilized Git for version control for the main projects and prototypes of the voice application.  </p>
											<p>This has definitely been a great learning experience for me.  The opportunity to work with some of the top software developers at a growing company has been beneficial, and I have taken away so much knowledge from this internship.  I came in not knowing much about web development aside from HTML5, but now am comfortable with javascript and utilizing node packages to put together a website.  As well, it was good to have experience working at a tech company that is fast paced, expects a lot from their workers, and has a significat presence in the tech world. </p>
											<p>Thank you to the fellow interns and great managers for this well put together program!    </p>
