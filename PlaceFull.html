												<h3>Seattle</h3>
											</header>
											<p>As a company, we took advantage of some of the great features Seattle has to offer.  During the World Cup, we watched the Sounders lose a close match to Germany in a video streaming at CenturyLink field.  We had the opportunity to ride on police boats in Lake Union and Lake Washington.  Coming off of a Super Bowl win, the NFL hosted a variety of opening day events right outside of our office!  Not to mention, the food options in the area are killer.</p>

												<h3>My Summer Internship</h3>
											</header>
											<p>I remember the first day I walked into work. I was greeted by an enthusiastic sales team, who immediately made me feel as if I was at home.  That day, I remember meeting the staff, and learning more about the basics of what PlaceFull does.  That first week or so, I acted as a new "merchant" by giving the company feedback on their website since I was a fresh set of eyes.</p>
											<p>For the next couple of months, I worked closely with the director of marketing, Adam Lang. I researched a multitude of verticals the company could reach out to such as painters, carpet cleaners, handymen, spas, photographers, and more. I then created the basic templates each business would "claim" if they signed up for PlaceFull's monthly service.  After researching in depth and calling various businesses, I came up with the top three services provided under each vertical, wrote descriptions, and found images that would stay consistent for all of the businesses until they claimed their page and could customize their listings. </p>
											<p>Some other work I did included researching various blog posts and articles (for example, how to use online booking for Facebook, emails, etc.) to incorporate as part of a campaign to post on behalf of PlaceFull's social media.</p>
											<p>My experience at PlaceFull was one I will always remember. It was unique to work with a small group of young and motivated individuals, many of whom had invested money in the company and wanted to see it succeed. I liked the idea of start-ups since there is a lot of flexibility with the direction the company wants to go, as well as the accountability factor so everyone must be a good co-worker both professionally and personally.  I thank Ryan Hamlin, CEO, for this great opportunity.  </p>
