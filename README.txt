Attached is information and a personal website for Tyler Yen.  Like a resume, it encapsulates and 
expands about Tyler's major experiences at Redmond High School and at Santa Clara University.  

This is my first website built, and some credit goes to Twenty by HTML5UP for a basic template, which 
I modified to fit my needs.
